# Contributing to the Community Website

Each & every project we build and/or maintain has been a possibility due to the community member efforts without which the projects would've been a distant dream only! As such, while we welcome all sorts of contributions to developing our community website, we ask the contributors to abide by certain rules & guidelines. These guidelines help us ensure:

1. Development practices are uniform.
2. Bug reports follow a standard procedure which makes it easier to debug & resolve certain issues quicker.
3. Submitting bug fixes, patches, feature requests through [Pull Requests (PRs)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
4. The details & examples to share when proposing a new feature.

As such this current document lists down such guidelines in complete detail which every contributor should follow while contributing to the project.

Do note, the statements detailed in this document aren't set in stone & individual contributors are expected to use their best judgement when developing and/or contributing to the project. And if you feel, certain portions of this document could use a rephrasing? Please do not hesitate to report it to us & open a PR referencing it!

## Code of Conduct

First of, our community welcomes people from all sorts of areas & expertise with varying years of experience. As such we ask you to be civil when interacting with another community be it on GitHub or elsewhere.

To enforce a civil & mature engagement among community members we drafted the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/developersIndia/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If you find anyone breaking the T&Cs of the aforementioned document please report us about the incident on over our email - contact.developersindia@gmail.com.

## How to Contribute to the Project

### Report bugs using Github's issue tracker

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs, weird features, broken URLs & such. More specifically, any thing out of the ordinary which shouldn't really exist in a website is tracked on our bug tracker.

You can report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/developersIndia/developersIndia.in/issues/new/choose), it's that easy! But before reporting an issue, please put in some effort & identify if similar reports have already been created by a previous individual.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Before Submitting a Bug Report

- Check if the content is being delivered to your browser. Sometimes a quick Hard Refresh(**Shift + Ctrl + R**) might resolve the issue.
- Determine if such a bug report has already been reported earlier or not.
- Take a screenshot of the bug if possible & take note of the Browser details.

### How to Submit a Good Bug Report

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- **Use a clear & descriptive title** to identify the issue & for obvious SEO reasons.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code).
- **Describe the behaviour you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behaviour.
- **Explain which behaviour you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, **record the GIF with this tool**: [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/).
- **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Project maintainers & authors _love_ thorough bug reports!

### Suggesting Enhancements

All projects maintained under the [developersIndia](https://github.com/developersIndia) banner are FOSS & as such welcomes public opinion on features & enhancements! And this section of the document will help you understand how to draft a detailed enhancement suggestion. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check
[this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out
that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement
suggestion, please
[include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion).
Fill in [the template](https://github.com/developersIndia/website/issues/new?assignees=Jarmos-san%2CBhupesh-V&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BFEATURE+REQUEST%5D%3A+), including the steps
that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

- **Discuss about it** by openning a [Discussion thread](https://github.com/developersIndia/website/discussions).
- **Check if there's already [an open issue](https://github.com/developersIndia/website/issues) which provides that enhancement.**
- **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/developersIndia/website/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to the project? You can start by looking through these `good-first-issues` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Good First Issues](https://github.com/developersIndia/website/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help Wanted Issues](https://github.com/developersIndia/website/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good-first-issues` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by the total number of comments. While not perfect, the number of comments is a reasonable proxy for an impact a given change will have.

#### Local development

TODO: Detail a complete step-by-step procedure on setting up the project locally.
