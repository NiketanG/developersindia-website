## GitHub Milestones

We use [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/developersIndia/website/milestones) to broadly organize what we intend to work on. Dates are only used for sequencing and do not represent a commitment.

| Milestones | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Current    | This milestone tracks individual tasks which has been accepted by the community & has to be worked on immediately.                                                                                                                        |
| Next       | Milestone for tracking tasks which are yet to be approved by the admin & are still receiving community feedback. Tasks which are added to this milestone requires further discussion, polishing & enhancement from the community members. |
| Future     | Milestone for tracking tasks which are approved by the admin team & the community but the implementation details is still under review & discussion.                                                                                      |

## Issue Triage & Prioritization

Incoming issues/discussions/etc. are triaged every now & then, labelled appropriately, and assigned to a milestone in priority order:

TODO: Add a list of milestones after they've been created

TODO: Add a "backlog" milestone for subsequent triage, prioritization & scheduling.

Please take note, **feature Priorities will be influenced by community feedbacks**.
